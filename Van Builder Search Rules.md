# Van Builder Search Rules

**The following rules are to be strictly followed. You will not deviate from them unless specifically instructed to do so.**

**Searches will be state by state in alphabetical order**

1. A thorough web search for that state will be performed to find as many legitimate van builders as possible. Accurate information from their websites will be added to our database. This information will include builder/company name, city, state, zip code, address if available, phone if available, email, any social media links, van types if that info can be found, amenities to the best of your knowledge and a brief synopsis of what they offer.  
2. If no phone is available an icon will still be placed on their card but it will say 'contact via email' when hovered over.  
3. Using a Playwright script, relevant photo url's from the builder will be collected and up to 8 photos will be used for the builder's gallery. If no photos are available the gallery will have a default 'No gallery images available' notice. All builders that have blank galleries will be added to a list so that we may go back and manually add photos to their galleries. 
4. Under no circumstances will fake or irrelevant data EVER be permitted to be used. All information and photos must be authentic to the builder.  
5. ALL OF THESE STEPS WILL BE FOLLOWED FOR EVERY BUILDER AND YOU WILL NOT MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STATE UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL STEPS FOR THE CURRENT STATE AND YOU GET PERMISSION TO MOVE ON.
